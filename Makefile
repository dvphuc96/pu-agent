# Make is not a framework — it's a 45-year-old command shortcut tool that
# ships with every Mac/Linux. Each target below is just the shell command
# you'd otherwise type. `make run` = "run the python below", nothing more.
#
# PY picks the project venv automatically so you never need to remember
# `source .venv/bin/activate` — both work, this is just fewer steps.
